### To-do's

- [x] 16*16 square grid using Javascript
- [x] Hover effect so that the divs change color when mouse passed over them
- [x] Button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
- [x] Show the current grid size on the top
- [ ] Instead of just changing the color in the hover, have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.
- [ ] Then try having each pass just add another 10% of white to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely white
