# Etch-a-Sketch

- [x] 16*16 square grid using Javascript
- [ ]Hover effect so that the divs change color when mouse passed over them
- [ ] Button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before. (SET A MAX LIMIT AT 100) - {Button, Prompt}
- [ ] Instead of just changing the color in the hover, have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.
- [ ] Then try having each pass just add another 10% of white to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely white
